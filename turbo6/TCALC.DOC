                        Turbo Pascal 6.0
                     Turbo Calc Information

Build Information
-----------------
  The following files are provided in TCALC.ZIP and are required
  in order to build TCALC.EXE:

    TCALC    PAS
    TCCELL   PAS
    TCCELLSP PAS
    TCHASH   PAS
    TCINPUT  PAS
    TCLSTR   PAS
    TCMENU   PAS
    TCPARSER PAS
    TCRUN    PAS
    TCSCREEN PAS
    TCSHEET  PAS
    TCUTIL   PAS
    TCCOMPAR OBJ
    TCMVSMEM OBJ

  In addition, TCALC uses the OBJECTS module, so make sure OBJECTS.TPU
  is available (located in the \TP\TVISION directory) in your unit
  path.

Types of Cells
--------------

  Value: A number.

  Text: A string - start it with a space to make sure that it
    doesn't get parsed.

  Formula: A string that is an expression (see explanation of
    expressions below). This cell will be constantly updated (if
    AutoCalc is on) to the current value of the expression.

  Repeat: A cell with a character that will repeat indefinitely
    across the spreadsheet. Type in the character that you want
    to repeat with a leading backslash (example: type \_ to get
    an underline across the screen).

General Information
-------------------
  Columns range from A to CRXO (65535), and rows range from 1 to
  65535.

  The little dot in the upper left of a spreadsheet tells you
  which of the spreadsheets is the current one. The number of the
  spreadsheet is also printed, along with 'F' if formula display
  is on and 'A' if AutoCalc is on.

  The file that the spreadsheet will be saved to is listed at the
  bottom of each spreadsheet, along with an asterisk if the
  spreadsheet has been updated.

Expressions
-----------

  Cell names in formulas are typed in with the column followed by
  the row:

    A1+A2
    B6^5

  To compute the sum of a group of cells, put a colon between the
  first cell and the last cell in the group:

    A1:A10    - Sum all of cells from A1 to A10 and puts the
                result in the current cell.

    A1:C10    - Sum of all of cells from A1 to A10, B1 to B10,
                and C1 to C10 and puts the result in the current
                cell.

Available Functions
-------------------

  ABS - absolute value
  ACOS - arc cosine
  ASIN - arc sine
  ATAN - arc tangent
  COS - cosine
  COSH - hyperbolic cosine
  EXP - exponential function
  LOG - logarithm
  LOG10 - base 10 logarithm
  POW10 - raise argument to the 10th power
  ROUND - round to the nearest whole number
  SIN - sine

The Parser
----------

  The state and goto information for the parser was created using
  the UNIX YACC utility. The input to YACC was as follows:

%token CONST CELL FUNC
%%
e : e '+' t
  | e '-' t
  | t
  ;
t : t '*' f
  | t '/' f
  | f
  ;
f : x '^' f
  | x
  ;
x : '-' u
  | u
  ;
u : CELL ':' CELL
  | o
  ;
o : CELL
  | '(' e ')'
  | CONST
  | FUNC '(' e ')'
  ;
%%

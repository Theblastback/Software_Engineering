  Programs compiled with {$G} compiler directive enabled do not
  check the processor at runtime to determine whether it is
  286-compatible. Trying to execute 80286 instructions on an 8086
  or an 8088 will lock up the computer. This program shows how to
  check for the presence of a 286-compatible chip at runtime.

  If you want to put code like this in a program with {$G+}
  enabled, put the test and halt code in the initialization
  section of the first unit in the main program's USES clause.

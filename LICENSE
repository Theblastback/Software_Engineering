The "turbo6" directory found here is a untouched copy of the Turbo Pascal 6.0 download available
from the following link (at least at the time of this writing):

http://library.thinkquest.org/27297/turbo6.zip

We are not 100% sure as to the current license for this software, but according to the Oracle(R) 
ThinkQuest Education Foundation, "This is Pascal 6 which is Freeware".  We are attempting to
find more specific details and will update this document with more specifics as we determine them.

The "atrobots" directory is a copy of the official AT-Robots 2.10 release from:

http://www.necrobones.com/atrobots

It's contents are licensed under the original modified BSD written by Ed T. Toten, III.
Because this code is the base upon which SUNYAT-Robots is written, the SUNYAT-Robot authors have 
modified this code to correct bugs and anomalies discovered since 1999, and modified the 
license statements in the appropriate files to identify their contributions.  All these changes are
a part of the revision history of this repository and are not meant to imply an updated official
release of the original Necrobones product, although we have modified the version number as such so
as not to confuse anyone running the modified executable.

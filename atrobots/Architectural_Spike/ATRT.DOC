ATRT - AT-Robots Tournament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is just a quick overview of how to use ATRT to run an automatic
and/or unattended tournament aith AT-Robots.

You need a functional copy of AT-Robots version 2.08 or higher,
and the ATRT archive must be decompressed into the same directory
as AT-Robots.

For the purposes of explaining the use of ATRT, this file will
use the example tournament that is included, "DEMO.TRN".


GETTING STARTED
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using ATRT is actually quite simple. As mentioned above, make sure
it is in the same directory as the ATROBOTS program. Then you will
be ready to begin.

To prepare for a tournament, you must first decide which robots
to include. To make things easier, it is best to create a subdirectory
under the AT-Robots directory to place the robots in. But for the sake
of this example, we will assume you are not doing this, and therefore
all of the robots will be in the AT-Robots directory.

The next step is to create a tournament file. For this example we will
use the sample file "DEMO.TRN" (tournament configuration files must end
in ".TRN"). Inside of the sample file you will see some comments that
describe each line. When you make your own tournament files, it will be
best to base them off of the sample.

ATRT will use all of the robots it finds in the tournament directory,
so because our sample has the directory line blank, it will use any
and all of the sample robots in your AT-Robots directory.

The next two lines in the tournament file specify the number of matches
per pairing, and the maximum time-limit for each pairing measured in
thousands of game cycles. For our example, we'll leave these set to 5
and 10 respectively.

The fourth line is a set of parameters that will be passed to ATROBOTS,
so we'll leave that set to "/^ /G /S /A".

Next, all you need to do is run ATRT and tell it which config file to
use. In this case we would run it like this:

  ATRT DEMO

ATRT assumes a ".TRN" extension and loads "DEMO.TRN", and then it scans
the directory for robots. These robots undergo a verification compile, and
any that are not determined to be valid robots are disqualified.

If instead of starting the tournament it says that the results are already
complete, you can type "DEL DEMO.RES" and then try again to force a re-run
of the competition. (for a while, ATR2 was being distributed with copies
of these demo files in it by mistake)

The tournament then begins. It defaults to graphics-off, so you see a
text-mode output of the current cycle count for each match, and also the
results of each match. During the tournament, you can still use the
standard AT-Robots keyboard commands, so you can watch the battles.
In fact, you may wish to actually remove the /G command from the
4th line in the .TRN file to make it display all of the battles in
graphics by default.

The tournament may take a while. If you abort it, you can resume, but
you must be careful not to change ANYTHING before you resume it, or you
can ruin the results, or ruin the tournament data (and thus be forced to
start over).

Once the tournament is complete, the results will be written in both
text and HTML formats. In this case they will be DEMO.RES and DEMO.HTM.
the .RES file is how ATRT keeps track of whether the tournament has been
completed or not, so if you wish to completely start over, just delete
the .RES file and ATRT will allow you to use the same .TRN file again.
Just keep in mind that you lose the old results, unless you backed them
up first. Personally, I name my tournament files sequentially (such as
T1, T2, etc), to keep them all seperate.

There will also be a .LOG file created during the tournament, which is
a log of the individual pairings in the competition, so you can see which
robots did well against which other robots.

And that's it! Enjoy!

REVISION HISTORY:

  1.01   - Changed terminology. Now the term 'pairing' is used instead of
             'bout' to make things less confusing.
         - Now uses /R3 report mode, and can thus track kills, deaths,
             and shots fired.

  1.02   - Now uses /R4 report mode.
         - Displays the best robots for several categories.

  1.03   - Now passes entire custom parameter list for the test-compile
             phase to disqualify robots based on settings (particularly
             when using /#).

  1.04   - Added option to score off a single /R4 report file (great for
             doing large rumbles).
         - "Best Marksman" and "Most Haphazard" now display the numbers
             correctly in the results outputs.

  1.05   - You can now put a '/y' parameter *after* the tournament name
             to make it automatically assume "yes" for yes/no questions).
         - Generates an overall report for the entire tournament in the
             standard /R4 format.
         - Maximum number of robots decreased to 512 to save some memory.
         - Fixed an uninitialized variable issue or three.
         - Changed the output stats to consolidate a few things.
         - Added "longest reign" and "newest contender" to generated
             results (which only show up if the number of matches differ
             between the robots).
         - Sorting of robots made a little cleaner, so that in the ranking,
             ties get broken by kills, then deaths, damage, longevity, and
             finally error rate.
